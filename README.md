## General information
Financeplanner is a client server based tool to manage your personal budget by assigning the total income of an month to budget-buckets. 

The most important principle is: Each budget-bucket should have a specific purpose.

The amount of money, located in a specific budget-bucket should be saved for a specific purpuse. 

For example it is possible to create a holiday-trip budget-bucket and assign maybe 20 Euro to this budget-bucket, every month. 

Budget buckets can have a target value. If this value is reached, the bucket is full and the purpose which is associted with ths bucket can be done because it contains enough money to do what is associated with it.

The budget plannung is done at the beginning of every month, when you get your payment from your job, you should assign the money to the specific buckets. At the end of the month, every euro should be assigned to a purpose.

During the month, you have to insert your financial transactions in the app to keep the buckets in sync with your real bank accounts. Every transaction must adress a specifiv bucket because everything must have a purpose. 

Apart from that, there will be several possibilities to make your budgeting more easy, for examle take over the values from the previous month, notifications about events, statistics and so on but the core value should be the budgeting method.

## User and Accounts
It is possible to work on a single budget with multiple accounts because it is possible that families have a shared budget for example. There must be at least one Budget-Administrator, associated to a budget who is able to manage access of other users towards his specific budget. In transactions, it is possible to show, who created a specific spent on a bucket.

A budget can consist of several budget sources, maybe a bank account or local savings or an investment fond. In case of transactions, a specific account has to be selected to keep the sync with your real accounts.
